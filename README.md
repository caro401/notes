# [Caro's notes](https://notes.caro.fyi)

This repository is the contents of my Obsidian vault for things I'm thinking about, learning about, or just want to remember.
It also includes the code to publish this vault as a [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) site.
See the markdown contents of my notes, and my current obsidian config in `/notes`, and stuff relating to the site in `/src`.

It deploys to cloudflare, but as a totally static site.

If you find something incorrect, please raise an issue or send me a pull request. Likewise, if you find a bit of code that I could do better.
Feel free to use this as an example for how to publish your own obsidian vault, or other collection of notes in markdown format.
If you're not confident how to do this technically, reach out and I can help!

Do all the things using the `justfile`. It assumes you have node and pnpm installed.
