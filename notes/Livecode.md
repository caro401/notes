## Performance examples

- [Benoît and the Mandelbrots performing in a TED talk with music and visuals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix2b_qFYfAA) in what looks like supercollider.
- [Kindohm Live @ ICLC 2016, Hamilton, Ontario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smQOiFt8e4Q) using tidal. Very strong start! Just the high quality audio is [available on bandcamp](https://kindohm.bandcamp.com/album/live-iclc-2016), along with a bunch more of their stuff. [The artist's website](https://www.kindohm.com)
- [SleepyAstroboi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK-34HPg4oY) does a bunch of stuff on YouTube, and shares some of their samples. They get a bunch of sounds through Ableton, including apparently the ability to sidechain!
- [A whole bunch here from ICLC 2024](https://www.youtube.com/@NYUSH_IMA/videos)
- [This is banging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsa9vU5_YnM) i really like the drum patterns. They made a whole album!

## Some of my strudel experiments

This is mostly me taking tutorials for making EDM from youtube and trying to recreate them in Strudel. I don't know much about making electronic music, so having some examples to start from is proving quite helpful.
