Learnings from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9APSgNZyt3I) "Spela andrast√§mmor och kompa i svensk folkmusik"

`iss` is sharp `ess` is flat. `Dur` is major, `moll` is minor.

you can make a really simple accompaniment by playing just the I and V chords of your key, start on I play it until feels bad, then switch, continue. (Like Jess Arrowsmith's "wibble" method for harmony singing!)

They teach a [cute lil tune!](http://www.folkwiki.se/Musik/1137)

Quite often, the second line follows the tune a third below (ish, to make it sound like something). Make sure you don't overpower the actual tune doing this though, and don't use it through the whole tune.

You can also play an octave below (usually) the tune. Again, not all the time, just for bits.
