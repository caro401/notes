Periodically people I know or work with ask for help with learning regex, and I always forget the links I send. Here they are.

- [regex 101](https://regex101.com/) My usual recommendation for explaining what regex actually does
- [cyrilex](https://extendsclass.com/regex-tester.html) another regex tester, featuring a regex visualizer, to help understand patterns
- [Regex vis](https://regex-vis.com/samples) from someone I don't remember on twitter, looks really nice but I haven't used much
