Moth larvae eat wool.

Prevention helps - scour fleeces as soon as they come in. Wash woolen garments, or anything that comes in. Store raw fleece in places that they can breathe before processing - pillowcase or something.

Vac bags are good, clear plastic boxes also. Going through your stuff and keeping eyes on things help - spot issues as soon as possible. Light also helps keep moths away, they like dark, undisturbed corners.

Cedar is a deterrent, but doesn't kill moths. Refresh cedar blocks regularly by sanding. Lavender works similarly, and possibly cloves.

Pheromone traps kill moths, but they are variety-specific. Mothballs are also a poison, but they smell bad and the smell will stay on your wool.
