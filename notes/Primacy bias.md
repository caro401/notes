Primacy bias means we remember the first thing more strongly, for example the first participant in user research, particularly if you are having a new experience doing the activity.

Also take good notes or recordings for this one, and make sure you interview everyone in the same way. This makes it easier to remember or notice unusual and important events in the research.
