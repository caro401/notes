I recently acquired a mac, and am learning about what the software ecosystem is like.

## That I have installed

Only things that are only for mac

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) as a launcher. I particularly like the find and open a git repo in VSCode [plugin](https://www.raycast.com/moored/git-repos). The built-in window management commands that make using a mac less terrible when coming from a tiling window manager.
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) because Scott Tolinski recommended in his [latest course](https://leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/command-line-essentials/introduction) as more full-featured than the built-in Terminal app. I spend much more time in the VSCode terminal though.
- [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) emoji picker

## That I should check out

- [text sniper](https://textsniper.app/) for OCR out of screenshots, pdfs and the like. Paid (Â£10) and in setapp
- [pearlcleaner](https://itsalin.com/appInfo/?id=pearcleaner) for properly uninstalling things and cleaning up all the files. Although maybe raycast can also do that?
- [cap](https://cap.so) might be useful if I ever need to do screen recordings. There's an open-source version that probably does everything I might need
