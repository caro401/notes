## That I have installed

Only things that are only for mac

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) because Scott Tolinski recommended in his [latest course](https://leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/command-line-essentials/introduction) as more full-featured than the built-in Terminal app. I spend much more time in the VSCode terminal though.
- [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) emoji picker

## That I should check out

- [text sniper](https://textsniper.app/) for OCR out of screenshots, pdfs and the like. Paid (Â£10) and in setapp
