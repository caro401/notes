There's lots of different database management systems (DBMSs) which you can use to interact with data in a database. They may be textual languages, or graphical interfaces. Some examples are:

- MySQL
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
- [[SQLite is a DBMS|sqlite]]
- Microsoft Access

There are tradeoffs to consider when choosing a DBMS

- is it free and/or open source? Do you pay for it in money you give to someone else to set up and run the system, or in your time to do that work?
- Does it have lots of fancy features, and therefore take more resources to run?
