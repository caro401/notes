I like to play folk tunes from the UK, the US, Canada, France, Belgium, Scandinavia etc, usually for dancing. Sometimes I write notes about or including tunes I play, or want to play. Here's a meta-note with them.

## Polskor

- [[Polska efter Ante Sundin]]
- [[Springlek]]
- [[Boda polska]]
- [[Eklundapolska nr 3]]

[[Rendering music in these notes]] is how I display them.
