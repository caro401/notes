> An artist statement is a concise arrangement of words that acts as a bridge to connect your audience to your art - p12

> Simple consideration for your reader goes a long way toward adopting a tone of directness and truth. Your readers/viewers will perceive your attempt to connect with them through the written word - p14

Use active voice - "I work in stone" not "Stone is the medium in which I work". - p17

Clauses you can put at the beginning of sentences to avoid everything starting with "I", for example "In all my work, I approach…" - p18

> You can't go wrong if you stick to the how, the what and the why of your work. - p19

I need to work through the prompts for having ideas about the "how, what and why" of my work. I just need to come up with a bunch of rough answers to as many of the provided questions as I can - p19-20

> Why did you make this? To answer, you need to write about the _beliefs, emotions and ideas_ supporting your work. This is the heart of the matter. -p21

There's another set of prompt questions I should fill in, and then a whole lot of fill-in-the-blank sentences to work through on p25.

> An artist statement's success is defined by its ability to provoke closer examination of the artwork - p32

A whole bunch of useful phrases I can reference and incorporate on p34

This bunch of tasks is summarised in the "plan of action" on p40

Being able to describe what you do and why really succinctly is important. Exercise of deleting words on p44.

> (introducing yourself) is a performance. Write your lines. Know your lines. - p44

Do that! Write a whole bunch of sentences then put them in "sentence-recycling bins" by topic - p48

I probably also need an artist bio.

> A bio is different and separate from an artist statement. […] Typically structured in narrative progression from past to present, your bio is written in the third person. It includes events relevant to your development as an artist; details such as where you come from, where you're based, influences, environment and training. - p54

> Go ahead and reveal a unique, insightful, personal or humorous detail about your life. it's a great way to draw your audience in and make them more receptive to your work. - p55
