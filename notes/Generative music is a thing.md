At some point, YouTube found me [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtYlgZh8mhk). I have no memory of when or why, but found it in the depths of my watch later list. The artist has a whole bunch of very cool sounding stuff on [their bandcamp]()

The title of the video "Generative Music | Max/MSP" seemingly refers to the software they are using - "Max" and "MSP". I searched for that, and came across [these course notes](https://cecm.indiana.edu/504/syllabus.html) for making generative music in Max. Looks very cool, but is waaaaay above my skills right now.

I'm intrigued by the idea of coding up something maybe adjacent to this, that can live in my browser and provide an endless stream of focus music for me. I have no idea if that's possible. Maybe tidal/strudel could do it? A project to remember I wanted to do, and come back to when I have some free time.
