I have a flatbed knitting machine. It's a Bond Incredible Sweater Machine that I found in a charity shop for essentially no money. I should use it more, and also learn more about knitting machines. The one I have is super basic, a lot of tutorials and patterns are for more Â complicated punchcard or computerised ones, or with ribbers.
