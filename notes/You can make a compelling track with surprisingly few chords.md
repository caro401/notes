You can pretty much get away with loads of pedal on a single chord, and maybe a bit of a progression with 3 or maybe 4 chords in. If you're feeling super creative, you can have another separate progression for a middle 8, but chances are you don't actually need it.

The interest in your track then needs to come from melody, riffs, drums and the like, as well as changes in the sounds making your chords, the voicing, what extra squish notes you include, what octave. And of course your production techniques
