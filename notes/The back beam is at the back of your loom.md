This is where you wind your un-woven [[Warp is the threads running the length of your cloth|warp]] before starting weaving.

You'll want to use some form of protection between the layers of your warp - sturdy paper, or warping sticks (thin bits of wood or thick cardboard) inserted as you wind the warp onto the back beam.
