Open devtools, in the JavaScript you can type `liveSocket.connect()` or `liveSocket.disconnect()` to play with what happens when you lose and regain connectivity. [Docs](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html#simulating-latency) , [video](https://youtu.be/Icmv09q3tUQ?t=1089) where I spotted someone do it first.
