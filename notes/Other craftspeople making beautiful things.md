- [Lottieknits](https://www.lottieknits.com) makes gorgeous hand-dyed yarn. They make particularly stunning gradients, I love the idea for their [Mini Fade Club](https://www.lottieknits.com/mini-fade-club) with tiny gradient skeins.
- [Jo Kalute](https://web.archive.org/web/20230602124721/https://jokalute.com/projects) ([on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hellojokalute/) and [Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com/profiles/jokalute)) does stunning surface pattern design. I discovered them through the [Craft Industry Alliance podcast](https://craftindustryalliance.org/powering-the-creative-economy-with-spoonflower/)

They also sell [punched tape washi tape](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1250829342/learn-to-write-in-binary-code-punch-tape) for you to write your own messages on
- [Ria Burns](https://www.riaburns.co.uk/shop) makes beautiful knitwear with naturally dyed yarn. They also sell naturally dyed yarn, dye plants and kits, and workshops about natural dyeing.

At some point they also sold tiny tassel earrings made from offcuts of yarn - a great way to minimise waste and also make something cute.
- [Ali Sharman](https://alisharman-weaver.co.uk/) makes woven things. I also love their logo, which looks like a weaving draft
- Kari Fell ([website](https://www.karifell.com/) and [shop](https://karifellartist.square.site/s/shop) )makes woven things, including scarves, cowls and bands. I love their colour and pattern choices. They also sell hand-dyed warps, which are beautiful
