[This person on the internet](https://www.web-goddess.org/archive/26597) made some really cool blob-shaped quilted reversible placemats. I should do that too. The idea of templating in paper, and checking how the shapes look with your dishes is neat. I really like the spiral pattern they used for the quilting. Using patterned fabric is a good idea to not show stains too much.
