[Here's the pattern on ravelry (warning!)](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/avocado-socks) . This is the designer's only pattern on Ravelry, and I couldn't find any more links for them.

This is the best-fitting sock heel for my particular foot anatomy (very small, very wide). I make it in the "large" (64 stitch) size, despite having tiny feet, because the length is adjustable and I need the width. The pattern is toe-up, and reliably tells you where the sock should come to on your foot at each point where they give length measurements. I do an anatomical toe of some sort.

There's 6 different bits of shaping, which is I think why it fits me so closely

- arch shaping, slow increases from the center stitch to add a narrow symmetrical wedge in the sole. Increase 8 stitches over 20 rounds.
- 4 different sections of short-row shaping to make the heel
- and some ankle shaping, taking out a small wedge at the back of the ankle after the heel. This make the sock look a bit like an avocado from the back, with the visible ankle shaping decreases.
