Draw-in happens naturally when the tension is released from the loom, so your cloth will be a bit (10% is common number, but it depends on lots of things) narrower than when it was on the loom.

Excessive draw-in can happen when you don't leave quite enough weft angle before you beat, and the cloth gets pulled in a bit at the selvedges.
