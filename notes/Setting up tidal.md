  - Install tidal cycles: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidalcycles/tidal-bootstrap/master/tidal-bootstrap.command -sSf | sh` from [MacOS | Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/getting-started/macos_install)
  - tidal is a DSL based in haskell, to talk to supercollider [index | SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/)
  - open Supercollider, run `SuperDirt.start` and maybe faff with settings. cmd-enter to run lines. Check for the server to be happy log lines, and green numbers at the bottom

```
Server.killAll // kill server
SuperDirt.start // start the server

// list devices
ServerOptions.inDevices
ServerOptions.outDevices

//set output devices (headphones on mac mini)
Server.default.options.outDevice_(ServerOptions.outDevices[3])
Server.local.options.outDevice_(ServerOptions.outDevices[3])
```

You might need to change input sample rate, do this with raycast 'audio MIDI setup'. After this, you can ignore supercollider.

pretty simple lil drum pattern

```
d1 $ sound "bd*2"

d2 $ sound "hh hh*<1 2> hh [hh*<1 2 1 8>]"

d3 $ slow 2 $ sound "~ sd ~ [sd*<1 1 1 3>]"

hush
```

- euclidean rhythms `d1 $ sound "bd(<3 2 3 4>,8)"` put 3 beats across (then 2 then 3 then 4)
- you can write lots of lines of code for one channel, switch between which ones you are running. Switch things up a lot so they don't get stale, remember you have the power to turn things off too
  Open VsCode (kinda like atom?), open a `.tidal` file. Run lines with shift-enter. remember `hush` to make it stop playing

- ableton has a learn synthesis thing [Learning Synths](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/). We are using supercollider as an audio synthesiser. The drums are samples
- supercollider can show you graphs of what it does - menubar -> server -> show scope
- `lpf` low pass filter, `room` for some reverb, `legato` for how much of the space the note takes up
- [https://dotpiano.com](https://dotpiano.com/) you can send midi (to get nicely sampled piano).
- you can bring tidal outside of supercollider's sounds by setting it up as a midi client

```
MIDIClient.init;
```
