Lots of people have ideas about what kinds of things you should take notes about, or what you should use your notes for. I'm collecting some of these ideas as I run across them, with currently no commentary on whether they are useful or meaningful to me. I'm thinking about how I want to structure my own notes as I find myself coming back to Obsidian more after a bit of a hiatus.

[This person](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/how-i-take-notes-structure-with-now-next-notes) uses notes about

- things they are doing and have done, including any decisions they make, however small. This helps with picking up work where they left off
- things they want to do, to help prioritise what to work on next, and to recall what ideas they had for a project that didn't get done for whatever reason.
- drafts of things they are writing - "no need for a separate app"
- Things they want to remember, like quotes and references, not necessarily as part of a project

Their time-bound things relating to projects and publishing live in folders `Now` or `Next`, depending on whether current or future. There's a note in at least one of the folders for each article they are writing, or project the are currently or want to work on. These [notes are structured](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/how-take-notes-my-obsidian-setup#content-anatomy-of-a-note) with a scratchpad at the top, and a log of what they did at the end. They have a separate `Notes` folder for the last category of non-actionable things, and an `Archive` for things that are completed or no longer relevant. They reference the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) from Tiago Forte.

[This person](https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/notes/how-i-organise-my-notes-project-active-resource-archive/) uses project-active-resource-archive notes (note this is _not_ PARA with areas). Their active notes are for time-based things (running todo list)m and things that happen or are relevant on a recurring basis.

[This person](https://hamatti.org/posts/how-i-take-work-notes-as-a-developer/) has a multi-layered approach to taking their notes ad a developer

- Daily notes, to help them understand where their time goes
- Meeting notes, created when the meeting is scheduled. This isn't notes/minutes from the meeting, rather gathering context and ideas in the run-up to the meeting, then capturing the most important points for them in addition to the general minutes, and any follow-up tasks they have.
- Running notes, documenting all the work they do, including dead ends ([[Recording  cancelled tasks is important]]). This is like a lab notebook of what you did/learned. It helps you get back in flow on a task if you are pulled away, and retains context around decisions you made in the process. Later they extract key points from these
- Topic notes, self-contained well-written notes about a single topic. These are share-able, publishable or can be sent to colleagues. They publish some at `/snacks` on their site.
- a Brag Document! Or rather two, one for their job and one for nice things people said about/to them
