[[SQLite is a DBMS|Sqlite]] columns can have one of 5 type affinities - `TEXT`, `NUMERIC`, `INTEGER`, `REAL` or `BLOB`. This is related but not the same as [[SQLite distinguishes storage classes and data types|storage classes]], which refer to individual values.

The default type affinity is numeric unless you give some data that doesn't fit it.
