A colour gamp is a piece of cloth meant to sample colour combinations in your warp and weft, in the same weave structure as you use for the colour gamp. Usually you use a striped warp, optionally separating each coloured stripe with a few ends of black or white, and then the same colour sequence in the warp.

This is great for learning about colour theory, and exploring the colours available to you if you often get yarns from the same range or supplier. But it is only really informative if you make the gamp using a weave structure (plain, twill, whatever) that you use often. They look really nice on the wall!

[Apparently, the word gamp comes from old slang for umbrella](https://handwovenmagazine.com/actual-definition-gamp/), because of the thing having sections.
