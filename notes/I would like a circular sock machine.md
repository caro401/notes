AKA a CSM

- [Someone 3d printed one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUcVIYgROpI) and talked a bunch about its quirks and how to use it. [They also made a flatbed knitting machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUKiXIdw2pI), with a whole bunch of links about connecting code and textile fabrication
- [Dean and Bean](https://www.deanandbean.com) is the 3D printed one you can buy that I'd run across before
- [Vintage instruction booklet](https://archive.org/details/instructionsforo00aike/mode/2up?view=theater)
- [Someone knitting on one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrTNHxu4Q5Y) [this one from thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4695746), and a [different person knitting most of a sock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7DEMIa16DE) on the same style of machine
- [EngineeringKnits has one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ybuJWnO6Uc), and links to some more vintage manuals
- [This person says a bit about history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRT-SEdBXmc). They made [a follow-up too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-w3kcYpAh4), adding a [variation to the machine](https://www.printables.com/model/355228-circular-sock-knitting-machine-for-my-mom-and-you)
- [SweetGeorgia got one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux4yaThZ5Qk) from [this manufacturer](https://erlbacherknitting.com/shop/) - suuuuuper expensive!
