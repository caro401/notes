As [one of my bands](https://portmanteaufolk.com) has been doing more playing for balfolk using synthesisers lately, I've been starting to explore other artists who do similar things. A small, incomplete list of artists I've found and enjoyed:

- [Mike Vass and Mairearad Green](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-d-a-m-mairearad-green-mike-vass#/) just kickstarted a new album. It has pipes and synths and is brilliant
- [Green Lads](https://www.viagramophone.com/green-lads) do Irish-ish stuff, it's great fun
- [Novar](https://www.novar.be/) do balfolk with just a hint of electronics
- [Apolkalypse](https://apolkalypse.bandcamp.com/album/a1) is totally pre-recorded music intended for ceilidh dancing. It ran at IVFDF a few years ago
- [The Drystones](https://www.thedrystones.co.uk/) do some interesting things. They got arts council funding to bring folk to young people
- [Event Horizon](https://www.gezafrank.com/projects) is whistle/pipes, guitar and fiddle with electronics, addressing physics themes. Dead website, but they have a [bandcamp page](https://eventhorizonproject.bandcamp.com) where you can buy their music.
- [Ramblxr by Elias Alexander](https://ramblxr.com/) calls itself "Celtic EDM", and has pipes. [Here's a music video](https://youtu.be/fvaVUoxpw04) of them doing livelooping, singing and playing a banging tune.

## technocontra

A whole bunch of people in the US are playing electronic music (rarely actually techno though) for contra dancing. [Jeff Kaufman has gathered a bunch of material about it](https://www.jefftk.com/news/technocontra). Apparently this has been going on for [a long time](https://web.archive.org/web/20110910055406/http://alexkg.com/blog/2011/06/a-brief-history-of-crossover-contra/). There's even a whole (now defunct) [blog](https://www.contrasyncretist.com/blog) about doing contra to music that isn't traditional.

Perpetual e-Motion have been doing live-looping of acoustic instruments for a while. [Here's an interview with them](https://digitalcommons.colby.edu/franco_american/6/), where they talk about using live looping to add depth and variety to the sound of just 2 musicians, and appealing to a broad range of dancers

I originally found technocontra via Julie Vallimont's contra band Buddy System (still my favourite contra band). Julie does a whole bunch of other music, and I ended up with an album from Firecloud[^1].

There's a whole spectrum of approaches from live looping to DJ, [live instruments over sequenced beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9xL1gfBgcY). [Jeff Kaufman categorises some people here](https://www.jefftk.com/p/fully-live-electronic-contra). Apparently he also has a band - they have [an album which I'm really enjoying!](https://kingfisherband.bandcamp.com/album/kingfisher-recorded-live)

In the UK, there's pretty much one outfit doing technocontra - [Bearded Dragons](https://bearded-dragons.bandcamp.com/album/bearded-dragons). They go mostly the live instrument over sequenced beats/synths approach, with a fiddle and a wall of modular synths and an unreasonable amount of Moogs.

[^1]: As is typical of folk music, there's no remaining website for them, just a bunch of dead links, but I did manage to find [their album on Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Firecloud/dp/B00IPQRBS0)
