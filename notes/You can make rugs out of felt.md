Ran across [this article about a design trend in rugs](https://www.dezeen.com/2024/11/21/peace-industry-softblock-rug/), and the [company Peace Industry](https://peaceindustry.com) that makes them. I'd never heard of making rugs out of felt, but in hindsight this is obviously a useful technique. Making a full size rug is probably not something I could attempt at home, but looking to this tradition for design inspiration for some mug rugs or something might be cool. They are really beautiful, I'd like to learn more about the history and the traditional kind of designs used, but don't really know where to start researching that. The name is "Namad" rug making, spelled in various ways. I don't know what it means.
