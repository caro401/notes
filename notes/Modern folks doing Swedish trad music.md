(and other nordic places, but I know most about Sweden).

## Big Huge Disclaimer

I'm an outsider on all this. I have no Swedish heritage, nor any formal study in ethnomusicology. I lived in Uppsala, Sweden for 18 months while studying there, and played and danced with the university folk ensemble. I'm not a fiddle player. I'm not an expert. Here's just some things I like.

If I've made mistakes or mis-represented something, [please tell me](mailto:hi@caro.fyi), I want to learn and do better.

## Nice bands and players to listen to

- Trio TÃ¶rn (Petrus Dillner),
- [northern resonance](https://www.northernresonance.se/)
