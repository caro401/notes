We ran it for a bit, then the box it was running on got repurposed and we never set it back up. Here's a collection of things I want to try if we ever set it up again

- [Write automations in elixir](https://www.jonashietala.se/blog/2024/10/08/writing_home_assistant_automations_using_genservers_in_elixir/) (also a really neat way to learn about how to use genservers, and some neat ideas about testing time-based things)
- [Set a static IP address](https://blog.ktz.me/set-a-static-ip-address-in-home-assistant-os/)
