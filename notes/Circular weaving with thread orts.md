Get all your thread/yarn orts, turn them into a circular weaving on an embroidery hoop. They recommend somewhere 4-7inches. Sand the hoop. Make a warp with some sewing thread, think about what you're going to be weaving when you decide how to space it. Weave on one plane, then stick the loose thread down to the back and anchor it. Use the super short bits in the middle of the hoop
