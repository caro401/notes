I've long been wanting to try out [Nix](https://nixos.org/), but I also value having a working computer and getting my job done, so have never actually taken the plunge. Then I ran across [Fleek](https://getfleek.dev/) somewhere on Discord, and thought it looks really promising.

I'm currently running 2 laptops and a desktop computer, of which one runs PopOS and two run MacOS. Keeping things the same between all the machines is a constant struggle, so setting up something to manage the dotfiles and applications installed on each would be really useful.

I installed Nix using [this installer](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix-installer) as recommended by Fleek, followed the [bootstrapping instructions](https://getfleek.dev/docs/installation) which are nice and clear (although they weren't kidding when they said `fleek apply` takes a while!).
