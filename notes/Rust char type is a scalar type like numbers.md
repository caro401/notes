Along with the various number types (`i32`, `f64`) and `bool`, `char` is a scalar type. You declare one by using single quotes, like `let z: char = 'â„¤';` , as opposed to the double quotes you use for string literals. Remember that a `char` might not line up with your human intuition of what a character/letter is - Rust's `char` is a 4-bit Unicode Scalar Value.
