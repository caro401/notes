> In order to be found you have to be findable

> Be on the lookout for voids that you can fill with your own efforts

> Become a documentarian of what you do

> once a day, after you've done your day's work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process that you can share.

> Attribution is about putting little museum labels next to the stuff you share

> Another form of attribution that we often neglect is where we found the work that we're sharing

> The stories you tell about the work you do have a huge effect on how people feel and what they understand about your work…

> … and how people feel and what they understand about your work affects how they value it

Thinking about how to present yourself:

> "By day I'm a web designer and by night I write poetry" […] "I'm a writer who draws"

> The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others.

> Share your reading list, point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online […] Take people step-by-step through part of your process.

> You can't be content with mastery; you have to push yourself to become a student again.
