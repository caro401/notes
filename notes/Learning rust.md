I'm having a go at properly learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), following the [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), or more specifically the [interactive version of the book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) to help my brain stay engaged. As usual, I'm pairing 'reading' the book with Firefox's reader mode and MacOS's TTS engine, because reading large chunks of text is hard for me.

My programming background is Python and Clojure, with a sprinkling of other things like JavaScript, TypeScript and Haskell, and this informs what I will probably find hard.

Why Rust and why now? The other day I stumbled across [this Reddit post about ADHD friendly programming languages](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_Programmers/comments/127ujwg/adhd_friendly_programming_languages/), which made me think about what I like in a programming language, and what I've been struggling with lately. Then my partner suggested taking a look at [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos), a super new and shiny front- and back-end web framework thingy for Rust. [This video walking some features of the newest release](https://youtu.be/AD3FHodVgE8) was such a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of things I've come across recently in the JavaScript world, so I decided to give Rust a go. I have a small web project in mind that I think Leptos would be a good fit for, but I definitely need to understand some fundamentals first!
