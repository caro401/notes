Or more specifically, the average float is the same in the warp and weft directions, and the warp and weft floats are evenly distributed on both sides of the fabric. Examples of balanced weave structures are [[Plain weave is one weft thread over one warp thread throughout|plain weave]] and 2/2 twill.

Contrast this with warp-faced and weft-faced weave structures.
