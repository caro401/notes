Jillian Eve used black walnuts to overdye a fast fashion dress. Let the walnuts get a bit soft, but not all the brown. They are really hard when they are green - you could get into them mechanically instead, or boil them to soften them.

Wear gloves!

> Enough walnuts to make the dye pot liquid dark brown. I used about 8 total.
> Aluminum Sulfate at 10% of the weight of the dress when dry.
> Prep walnuts, extract dye by simmering walnuts, removing walnut hull, continue to simmer kernals for another hour.
> Strain dye liquid and submerge dress. Simmer for another hour.
> Let cool then rinse dress. Done!

Remember that overdyeing, and/or changing buttons and the like are all options to help you fall back in love with things you own but don't wear.
