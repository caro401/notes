Equity focussed design is the UX industry's goal these days, taking [[inclusive design]] one step further. Focus on designing for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored when building products.

**Equality** means providing the same amount of opportunity and support to all segments of society, everyone gets the same thing.

**Equity** means providing different levels of opportunity and support for each person in order to achieve fair outcomes. Taller boxes for shorter person, not one box for all people.

Build products that specifically meet the needs of those who have been excluded in the past. This doesn't solve all problems, but does help a bit towards designing for a more equitable future. These should be requirements all the time.
