Springlek is a fast polska from Västerdalarna with a short first beat

[[Learn about polska|As I'm learning about polska]], there's loads of different kinds!

The distinct feature of this kind of tune is the short first beat "kort etta", very short with a heavy emphasis on the 2nd beat. Sometimes you see an extra heavy dance step on the second beat. Quite often see tied notes across the barlines

Here's a [cool tune](https://spillefolk.dk/nodesamling/visnode.php?key=po-lissmyrerik3) from near Malung. Here's [someone teaching it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inTBNXRLTng). Note that the F notes are slightly sharper than may be expected

People who play in this tradition: Mattias Helje, Lars Halvarsson, Kalle Almlöf.

There's other kinds of kort etta polskor too - [[Vrmland polska|Värmland polska]], [[Boda polska]] (also Dalarna) and [[Røros pols]] (Norway).

Don't learn tunes like this from written dots! You really need to learn them by ear, and just use dots as a memory aid that the tune exists.
