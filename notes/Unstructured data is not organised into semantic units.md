Unstructured data is data that is not organized into distinct, pre-defined semantic units. Typically, this means data in free text format.

Humans can process unstructured data by reading it, understanding its contents, and making inferences using context and common sense. Computers are bad at all of these things, so it is really hard to get computers to do useful things with unstructured data.
