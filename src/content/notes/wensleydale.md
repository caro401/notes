I have some wensleydale locks, what do I do with them?

It's a longwool, so will have sheen, like a lower twist angle, have a halo. Too much twist and it will be really ropey. Convention will say you can't wear longwools next to skin. Fine spun can knit into nice lace outerwear with a halo.

Longwools might be nice weaving yarns? I guess that's a nice way to make use of the lustre in a wrap or scarf or something.

Felts well? but that feels like a waste of such gorgeous fibre.

Save a lock sample! measure the staple length

General ideas for [what do to with longwools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_gfDK6WaiQ)
	- comb the stuff! definitely don't put it on a drum carder, because the really long locks are hard to get off.
	- tailspinning if you want art yarn
	- they probably like dye, because of the lustre

go read the fleece and fibre sourcebook on it!

- people on youtube doing breed studies:
	- [Wool n' Spinning](https://www.youtube.com/live/Agh3d9OKDrY?si=PDGcPkxJDpLUtHUI&t=1190)
		- Don't hold too much in your hand at once, consider pre-drafting a bit and also add a little bit of twist at this stage.
		- maybe it likes being singles? Definitely happier as 2 than 3-ply
	- [Lisa My Eclectic Life]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlxtLFwZwU4)
		- they have loads of info about the breed and history.
		- comb it, but there's a lot of waste. You could card the waste maybe, but its long and a bit awkward.
		- Maybe shorter locks aren't so bad to drum card?
		- Worsted draw is fine, but might feel unexpected because your hands are so far apart.
		- might be good as embroidery/sewing thread because of the lustre and how well it takes dye
		- interesting that they spin and ply to a EEW off to the side, I'd not thought to sit like that, maybe it's more comfortable? Should definitely give it a try

		- similar to teeswater in numbers, so advice for teeswater should also be applicable.
		- can cut in half to card.
		- drape, clear stitch definition, no stretch/spring. Very good for lace - they have some other stuff with beads in for lace - that's neat!
		- good for a warp yarn even
