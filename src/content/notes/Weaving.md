I own an [Ashford rigid heddle loom](https://www.winghamwoolwork.co.uk/rigid-heddle-loom.html) in the 24inch/60cm size, and a DIY [[A backstrap loom is a loom tensioned with your body|backstrap loom]] that I made from some rolling pins, a ruler and some cable ties.

## Techniques

- [[Clasped Weft Weaving]]
- [[Choosing yarn for your weaving project]]
- [[Project planning and calculations]]
- [[Wet-finishing woven pieces]]

## Projects

- [[Notebook Covers on a rigid heddle loom]]
- [[Tote bag from a long strip of cloth]]
- [[Colour gamp or colour sampler]]
- [[Rag rugs]]

## Tools

- [Seizenn band weaving pattern editor](https://www.raktres.net/seizenn/editor.html) and the [updated version](https://www.raktres.net/seizenn/) (which is a bit too complicated for me at the moment). These are great for designing cool striped warps for band weaving.
