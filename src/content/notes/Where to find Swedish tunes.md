Sweden's equivalent of [thesession.org](https://thesession.org) is [folkwiki.se](http://folkwiki.se). Denmark's is [spillefolk.dk](https://spillefolk.dk/nodesamlingen/), which also has a bunch of Swedish and Norwegian stuff.

There's also an online collection of archival material [Folkmusikkommissionens notsamling och Musikmuseets spelmansböcker](https://katalog.visarkiv.se/lib/views/fmk/Default.aspx?item=182) which is searchable. [A huge collection of tunes from Gotland](https://github.com/erikronstrom/gotlandstoner), available to download in ABC format. [Some scanned notebooks](https://www.stefanlinden.se/huvudtext_skannade_latar.html)

[Blue rose](https://bluerose.karenlmyers.org/wp/) av Karen Myers

[this thing](https://timraspelman.se/musik_galleri.aspx/) which apparently has lots of written-out harmony lines

Some individuals have online tune collections, for example [Henrik Norbeck's](https://www.norbeck.nu/abc/index2.asp?cat=s) and [Martin Linden's](https://www.martinlinden.se/). Occasionally, tunes end up on The Session, or folktunefinder. Sometimes this has useful information, sometimes is just [catastrophically wrong](https://thesession.org/tunes/17179).

The book series "Svenska låtar", which I can borrow from my local library. This is one of the oldest and most influential big collections. It is grouped by area(?), and popularised that kind of categorising tunes (cite that book kaminsky??)
