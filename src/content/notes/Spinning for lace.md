If  you have locks, you might want to spin with the tip end going in first, as this might be less inclined to pill - [Source](https://margaretstove.nz/) , [but this is controversial](https://spinoffmagazine.com/which-end-first-spinning-from-the-lock/). If you've got brittle tips, for example on merino, break them off. You probably want a short backwards draft, but not pulling quite to the staple length so you don't get weak spots even if you have long locks. You might want to spin from the fold of commercial top, as this can help pull fibres back into alignment. The drafting triangle can be pretty translucent, you want about 45degree angle of twist - this isn't a high twist yarn. 

Your brake band tension should be really light so you aren't fighting the wheel, more so for finer spinning. You can also spin lace on a spindle, as long as it is a small light one.

Rest your singles at least overnight before plying. You probably don't want any tension on your lazy kate. Tension all singles over the same finger, so you don't make one single stretch more than the other. Prefer a 2-ply yarn for lace

If you make a tiny sample skein, make it short, tie the middle and wash/finish one half only so you can compare what good and bad bits look like before washing.

Making the core of your bobbin fatter can help - you can diy this with pipe insulation. This helps reduce takeup.
