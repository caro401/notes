I'm taking [CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://www.edx.org/learn/sql/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-databases-with-sql) on edX as a refresher, and a way to cement my fundamental knowledge of databases. I've used SQL a bunch, but never really formally sat down to learn things, so this should be good for me.

- [[A DBMS is a way to interact with a database]]
- [[SQL is a language used to interact with data in a database]]
- [[Relational databases usually have several tables with related data]], and [[keys are used to relate data]]
- [[Entity relationship diagrams are used to visualise the schema of data in a database]]
- [[A database schema defines the tables and columns in a database]]
- [[Table constraints impose restrictions on values in tables]]
- [[SQLite imports from CSV as text data by default]]
- [[SQL triggers are statements that run in response to other statements]]
- [[A view is a virtual table defined by a query]]
