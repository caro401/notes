Current hyperfixation interest is learning how to build musical instruments, specifically a [Nyckelharpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyckelharpa) of some sort. Because these are pretty hard to acquire in the UK, there's very few makers and most of them are old.

For now, just a dump of ideas, resources, things I've found or am thinking about, with no particular organisation

- [This dude writes a little about building one](https://www.nyckelharpa.org/wp-content/uploads/nn_37.pdf), specifically reference to plans by Sören Åhker, and associated DVD course _Build Nyckelharpa with Sören Åhker_ - [clip available on youtube?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEVolmHI5rE)
