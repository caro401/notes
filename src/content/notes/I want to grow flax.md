I have the idea that at some point I will grow, harvest, process, spin and weave some flax. No more thoughts than that just yet. Working with nettle seems to be somewhat similar. A lot of people doing this are super into historical reenactment things. I am not, more interested in the sustainability aspect, ownership of my own clothing, slow fashion.

I bought a little bit of prepared flax to have a go at spinning it without all the rest of the process. Have not yet done it.

Here's a bunch of resources I've gathered about the process:

- [this dude doing it in northern england](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JKhhtoe9v4)
- Allan Brown seems to be a UK expert in this kind of thing, [here's a video of him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0SFRIZqkfE)
- [someone's video going through the whole process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VKN04zmEjg), including some books they recommend. They are from california, and grow tightly on their balcony in raised beds.
	- plant the flax seeds kinda close together so it grows straight up
- [another group of americans doing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLOPCAJKeLE), explaining most of the bits of the process.
- [someone doing something similar with wild plants including nettle and milkweed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy1tw-7sI7k), broadening the idea of what can be a fibre plant (in the US).
- [spinning flax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqr-GRveyRg), and [how to dress a distaff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EpceAEdQZQ) - flax fibre is a pain and tends to chaos - re-combing it might help, as does working with damp hands. Spinning from the fold (directly or from rolled up ends on a distaff) probably works well.
questions:

- where can get flax seed in the UK? [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JKhhtoe9v4) suggests <www.flaxland.co.uk> and <www.wildfibres.co.uk>, and to make sure its a special type for long fibre, not for food seeds.
- is there a history of flax where I'm from (cambridgeshire currently, yorkshire previously)?
